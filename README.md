# Geppetto System

## Introduction

The Geppetto System is a comprehensive solution designed to facilitate the exploration of environments using a team of robots. This system is composed of three main parts: the ground station, the onboard robot software, and the simulation environment. The ground station is an interface that allows operators to control and monitor the robots, while the onboard software handles the robot's sensors, navigation, and communication. The simulation environment, powered by Gazebo, enables testing and validation of the system's functionalities before deployment on physical robots.

## Features

- **Web-based Interface**: A user-friendly web interface for operators to control and monitor the robots.
- **Real-time Communication**: Continuous communication between the robots and the ground station using a 2.4 or 5 GHz channel.
- **Autonomous Exploration**: Robots can explore the environment autonomously, avoiding obstacles and generating a map of the area.
- **Simulation Environment**: Gazebo-based simulation for testing and validating the system's functionalities.
- **Data Collection**: The ground station collects data generated by the robots and produces a map of the environment.
- **Battery Management**: Automatic return to base when the battery level drops below 30%.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Continuous logging of sensor readings and commands for debugging purposes.

## Technologies

### Ground Station

- **Frontend**: Angular framework for the web interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Nest.js for the server.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing collected data and logs.
- **Communication**:

### Onboard Robot Software

- **Programming Language**: Python or C++.
- **Framework**: ROS (Robot Operating System) for managing sensors, navigation, and communication.
- **Communication**: Communication between robots and the ground station.

### Simulation Environment

- **Simulator**: Gazebo for simulating the robots and the environment.
- **Programming Language**: Python or C++ for the control software of simulated robots.
- **Framework**: ROS for managing sensors, navigation, and communication in the simulation.
